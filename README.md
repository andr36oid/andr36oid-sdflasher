# warn
as of right now, no publically available release of andr36oid is compatible with this tool. the next release will require using this tool if you are updating. if you are flashing a fresh sd card, this tool will make the process easier.

# what this
The next version of andr36oid will introduce a new partition layout. New users can flash with a tool like Rufus, but existing SD cards need to be repartitioned.

An ordinary flash would render the system unbootable or with data loss. This tool can alter the partition table of an existing install of andr36oid to the new format, as well as flesh any other SD card with our image.

The new partitioning layout enables two things: Project Treble compatibility (and thereby GSIs), Android versions greater than 11 (not implemented or tested to date), and noticeably faster bootup time.

## what is it not
an effin web browser pretending to be an app (looking at you etcher)

faster than rufus. this app will be slower than rufus. it validates what it writes as it writes to your card. this is because many cards, frankly, suck. this has led to many an inquiry in our telegram chat, and a better sd card usually solved the problem. I hope that readback verification will catch unsuitable SD cards before you put them in your console and be disappointed by the OS not booting.

## how use
Go to GitHub releases, and download the binary for your platform. You can use Windows, Linux, macOS and Android.

You do not need to download the andr36oid image. The flash tool will download it from GitHub for you (you can manually specify one if required).

To update to future releases of andr36oid, simply run the flash tool again.
